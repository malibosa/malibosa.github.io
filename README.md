Hello, Im looking anyone could help me to fix an issue in my code, 
its in index.html
Problem is: (except terrible grammar) that the drop down hover doesnt work on phone screen
(I know hovers doesnt work on touch device, but neither does onclick) 
If you see the code on your desktop and if you hover on "skills>Mixology, Computing, etc" you will see drop down windows. 
But if you do it on  phone it doesnt work.
Have look on https://malibosa.github.io/index.html
If anyone could help I would appreciate and you would get extra good karma points.
Thank you, you too kind.
